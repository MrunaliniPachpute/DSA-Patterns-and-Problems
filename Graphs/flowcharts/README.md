# Flowcharts for Graphs Problems

This folder contains flowcharts for all 5 problems in the Graphs topic. The flowcharts are implemented using Mermaid diagrams directly in the HTML files.

## Implementation Details

- **Technology**: Mermaid.js for interactive flowcharts
- **Integration**: Flowcharts are embedded directly in each problem's HTML page
- **Functionality**: Each page has a "View Flowchart" button that toggles the flowchart visibility
- **Styling**: Uses existing CSS classes for consistent styling

## Problems with Flowcharts

1. **BFS & DFS Traversals** (`bfsDFS.html`)
   - Shows all three approaches: BFS, DFS Iterative, and DFS Recursive
   - Visualizes the decision flow and algorithm steps

2. **Connected Components** (`connectedComponents.html`)
   - Covers DFS, BFS, and Union-Find approaches
   - Shows the component counting logic

3. **Minimum Spanning Tree** (`minSpanningTree.html`)
   - Implements both Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms
   - Visualizes the edge selection and weight calculation process

4. **Shortest Path** (`shortestPath.html`)
   - Covers BFS (unweighted), Dijkstra's (non-negative weights), and Bellman-Ford (negative weights)
   - Shows the distance calculation and relaxation process

5. **Topological Sort** (`topologicalSort.html`)
   - Implements both DFS post-order and Kahn's algorithm
   - Visualizes the ordering process and in-degree management

## Features

- ✅ Interactive toggle button
- ✅ Clear, readable flowcharts
- ✅ Consistent styling with existing design
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ No external dependencies (uses CDN for Mermaid)
- ✅ Beginner-friendly visual explanations

## Usage

1. Navigate to any problem page in the Graphs topic
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page
3. Click the "View Flowchart" button
4. The flowchart will appear below the problem content
5. Click "Hide Flowchart" to collapse it

The flowcharts help learners understand the algorithm approach visually alongside the pseudo-code, making the repository more interactive and beginner-friendly.
